        <h2>3. Service Description</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Nature of the Service</h3>
        <p>Moth Models is a subscription-based digital ecosystem operated by Moth Solutions Ltd, designed to empower models and creative professionals through integrated website creation, administrative management, and portfolio hosting. The Service operates under the primary domain moth.solutions/models for public access and onboarding, while all subscription management, account administration, and hosted websites are executed through modelsweb.co and its associated subdomains. The platform provides a unified dashboard, admin.modelsweb.co, where users can control every aspect of their online presence, including site content, visibility, analytics, and personal data.</p>
        
        <p>Each subscription package includes access to a personalized dashboard and a professionally developed portfolio website. Upon successful checkout via Stripe, users receive their account credentials and a confirmation receipt by email. Custom websites are created by the Moth Solutions team within approximately two to five (2–5) business days. Each website is deployed under a unique subdomain (e.g., username.modelsweb.co), selected by the User during setup, subject to availability and Company naming policies.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Available Features</h3>
        <p>The Service provides a range of professional tools accessible through the administrative dashboard, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Profile Management:</strong> editing personal details, measurements, biography, and contact visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Gallery Management:</strong> uploading, organizing, and controlling visibility of photos, tagging locations, and exporting selected sets as PDF portfolios.</li>
          <li><strong>Website Customization:</strong> choosing templates, managing live status, and requesting paid custom design upgrades.</li>
          <li><strong>Booking Management:</strong> reviewing and managing booking requests, maintaining communication logs, and tracking client interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> viewing engagement metrics, traffic insights, and performance statistics for both profile and website activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Account Settings:</strong> password management, two-factor authentication, and full account deletion options.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing & Subscription:</strong> pausing or cancelling subscriptions, reviewing invoices, and managing payment methods directly through the dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.3 Subscription Model and Access Limitations</h3>
        <p>Access to Moth Models requires an active paid subscription, processed via secure Stripe integration. The subscription provides continuous access to all standard features for the duration of the paid term. Users may cancel or pause their subscriptions at any time through the Billing section of their dashboard; however, the Company does not guarantee refunds for partial billing periods. Certain premium features—such as custom website design, advanced analytics, or additional storage—may incur supplementary charges. The Company reserves the right to adjust feature availability or pricing to maintain platform performance and service integrity.</p>

        <h2>4. Account Registration & Security</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Registration Process</h3>
        <p>To access and use the Service, Users must create an account either by providing a valid email address and secure password or by authenticating through Google Sign-In. During registration, Users are required to verify their email address to activate full account functionality. Upon account creation, a temporary password is automatically generated and sent to the User's registered email address. For security reasons, the Service strongly advises Users to change this temporary password immediately after their first login. Registration information must be accurate, complete, and current. Accounts created with false or misleading data may be suspended or terminated at the Company's discretion.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 User Responsibility for Accuracy</h3>
        <p>Users are solely responsible for ensuring that all personal, billing, and professional details provided within the platform remain accurate and up to date. The Company shall not be held liable for any service disruption, loss, or miscommunication resulting from inaccurate or outdated information. Any misuse of identity, impersonation, or provision of falsified data constitutes a material breach of these Terms.</p>
        
        <h3>4.3 Account Security, Passwords, and Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
        <p>Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login credentials and for all activity conducted through their accounts. The use of strong, unique passwords and activation of two-factor authentication (2FA) are strongly recommended to enhance account protection. The Company shall not be responsible for unauthorized access resulting from a User's failure to safeguard credentials. If you suspect unauthorized access or a security breach, you must immediately notify the Company via the official support channel.</p>
        
        <h3>4.4 Suspension and Termination of Accounts</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate any User account without prior notice if there is a reasonable belief of violation of these Terms, fraudulent activity, misuse of the Service, or behavior that could harm the integrity of the platform or other Users. Users may voluntarily delete their accounts at any time through the Account Settings section. Upon deletion, access to all data, websites, and associated content will be permanently removed, except as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Cancellation of Subscription</h3>
        <p>Users may cancel their subscription at any time through Settings → Billing within the administrative dashboard. Upon cancellation, the User's account remains active until the end of the current paid term. After the term expires, the subscription and related website access will be automatically terminated. Users may reactivate their subscription at any time by resubscribing through the platform.</p>
        
        <h3>5.4 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>All payments made to Moth Solutions Ltd for Moth Models are non-refundable. Refunds are issued only in cases of verified system error or duplicate transaction directly caused by the Company's billing system. In such cases, the refund will be processed immediately to the original payment method.

        <h2>5. Payment and Invoicing</h2>
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd maintains a highly structured, transparent, and client‑focused financial framework that reflects our professional standards and ensures equitable protection for both parties. Every payment arrangement is individually documented, formally agreed upon, and governed by a written Statement of Work (SOW), quotation, or project agreement issued by the Company.</p>
        
        <h3>5.1 Financial Governance and General Principles</h3>
        <p>All pricing, payment schedules, and deliverable structures are confirmed in writing prior to initiation of any work. Verbal commitments are not binding until reflected in a formal document issued by Moth Solutions.</p>
        
        <p>The Client acknowledges that payment obligations form an essential part of contractual performance; failure to comply with agreed terms may result in suspension or termination of Services.</p>
        
        <p>All transactions are executed in the contractually defined currency—by default GBP (British Pounds)—unless otherwise approved in writing.</p>
        
        <p>Invoices are due within 7 to 14 calendar days of issue unless explicitly stated otherwise in the governing contract.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2 Milestone‑Based Development Model</h3>
        <p>Most bespoke software and digital projects at Moth Solutions operate under a milestone‑based structure designed to align payment with measurable progress, ensure delivery accountability, and maintain mutual financial confidence.</p>
        
        <p>Projects are divided into milestones representing distinct, verifiable development stages.</p>
        
        <p>Each milestone is financially independent and governed by its own set of deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria documented in the SOW.</p>
        
        <p>Each milestone payment is divided into two segments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>50% pre‑payment</strong> — payable prior to commencement of the milestone; secures allocation of technical resources, planning capacity, and development priority.</li>
          <li><strong>50% completion payment</strong> — payable upon verified delivery and Client confirmation that the milestone deliverables meet the specified scope and performance requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Upon full payment and written acceptance of a completed milestone, the associated portion of intellectual property and deliverables becomes the Client's property in accordance with Section 6.</p>
        
        <h3>5.3 Performance Assurance and Refund Rights</h3>
        <p>In the unlikely event that Moth Solutions fails to deliver the services or outputs defined within a specific milestone, the Client may request a proportional refund for the undelivered scope.</p>
        
        <p>Refund eligibility requires evidence of non‑performance and the Client's adherence to all cooperation duties (e.g., timely feedback, content provision, and decision approvals).</p>
        
        <p>All refund assessments are subject to internal review and documentation verification by Moth Solutions' finance and project management departments to ensure fairness and compliance.</p>
        
        <h3>5.4 Alternative Payment Structures</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the diversity of client needs and project complexities, Moth Solutions supports several alternative billing frameworks:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fixed‑Price Engagements:</strong> Pre‑defined total project price with milestone triggers and capped costs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Retainer or Subscription Models:</strong> Continuous or recurring service engagements billed monthly or quarterly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Time and Materials (T&M):</strong> Billing based on tracked resource hours and real‑time consumption of development capacity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hybrid Structures:</strong> A custom blend of fixed, retainer, and milestone components where flexibility is required for long‑term or evolving projects.</p>
        
        <p>Alternative payment structures are valid only when formally documented and approved by both parties. The definitive terms will always be reflected in the official financial schedule provided by Moth Solutions.</p>
        
        <h3>5.5 Late Payments, Disputes, and Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Late or incomplete payments may trigger service suspension, delayed delivery schedules, or administrative penalties as outlined in the Client's invoice terms.</p>
        
        <p>Continued non‑payment beyond the stated grace period authorizes Moth Solutions to withhold Deliverables, cease work, or initiate formal recovery proceedings.</p>
        
        <p>Any payment‑related disputes must be raised in writing within five (5) business days of the invoice date. Failure to do so constitutes acceptance of the invoice as valid and due.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions may charge interest on overdue amounts at the maximum rate permitted under the UK Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.</p>
        
        <h3>5.6 Taxation and International Transfers</h3>
        <p>All invoices are compliant with UK accounting and tax legislation. Prices are quoted exclusive of VAT unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
        
        <p>The Client is responsible for covering any applicable withholding taxes, import duties, or international transfer fees related to cross‑border transactions unless agreed in advance.</p>
        
        <h3>5.7 Flexibility and Final Determination of Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>Payment frameworks, milestone segmentation, and refund policies are adaptable to reflect project scale, complexity, and client preference, but always finalized in writing.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions reserves the right to modify payment timelines or structures upon mutual agreement, provided that written approval is secured from both parties.</p>
        
        <p>The final, binding version of the payment schedule and associated conditions will always be detailed in the official documentation issued by Moth Solutions at project commencement.</p>
        
        <h3>5.8 Integrity and Professional Conduct in Financial Dealings</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions upholds a zero‑tolerance policy toward financial misrepresentation, unauthorized discount claims, or manipulative payment practices.</p>
        
        <p>The Company ensures transparency through digital invoicing, recorded payment confirmations, and auditable transaction records.</p>
        
        <p>All parties agree to maintain ethical financial conduct, mutual respect, and prompt resolution of monetary obligations.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd's payment governance model balances flexibility with accountability, ensuring that both the Client and the Company operate within a framework of fairness, documentation, and verifiable delivery progress. This system enables sustainable project execution while reinforcing trust and professional discipline across all engagements.</p>

        <p>The Company makes no warranties regarding third-party software and disclaims liability for external licensing restrictions or subsequent changes to third-party licensing terms.</p>
        
        <h3>6.3A Use of Third‑Party Materials and Portfolio Examples</h3>
        <p>From time to time, Moth Solutions may publish screenshots, thumbnails, or short excerpts of third‑party websites, publicly available materials, or Client Deliverables on the Platform or in marketing collateral for portfolio, case‑study, demonstration, comparative, or educational purposes (collectively, "Third‑Party Materials"). Such use is undertaken only where Moth Solutions reasonably believes it is permitted by law (including under applicable fair use/fair dealing exceptions), by the third party's published terms, or under an express licence or permission obtained from the rights holder. The inclusion of Third‑Party Materials does not constitute an endorsement by Moth Solutions of the underlying site, product, or service, nor does it transfer any rights in those materials to Platform visitors.</p>
        
        <p>Where Third‑Party Materials contain trademarks, logos, or other proprietary elements, Moth Solutions will obtain explicit permission where required for the intended use. If a rights holder objects to the presence of particular materials, Moth Solutions will investigate and, where appropriate and legally required, remove or restrict access to the material upon receipt of a valid takedown request directed to legal@moth.solutions.</p>
        
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Clients commissioning bespoke work grant Moth Solutions a perpetual, royalty‑free, non‑exclusive licence to display screenshots or brief extracts of the Client Deliverables on Moth Solutions' marketing channels, website, and portfolio for the purpose of promoting our Services; any broader use will require separate written consent.</p>
        
        <h3>6.4 Confidential and Trade Secret Material</h3>
        <p>All proprietary know-how, technical documentation, workflows, and data structures developed or provided by Moth Solutions are considered trade secrets and shall not be disclosed, copied, or reverse-engineered without written consent.</p>
        
        <p>The Client acknowledges that unauthorized use or disclosure of such materials may cause irreparable harm and agrees that Moth Solutions is entitled to seek injunctive relief, damages, or both.</p>
        
        <h3>6.5 Derivative Works and Enhancements</h3>
        <p>Any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works based on Moth Solutions' software or systems remain the intellectual property of the Company unless explicitly assigned in writing.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions reserves the right to reuse generic components, non-identifiable frameworks, or design methodologies across multiple projects without limitation.</p>
        
        <h3>6.6 License Conditions</h3>
        <p>Any license granted by Moth Solutions is conditional upon full payment of all fees and compliance with these Terms.</p>
        
        <p>The Client may not sublicense, resell, rent, or distribute the Deliverables to third parties without prior written authorization.</p>
        
        <p>Breach of license conditions will result in immediate termination of the license and potential legal enforcement.</p>
        
        <h3>6.7 Protection and Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions enforces a zero-tolerance policy toward infringement of its intellectual property rights. The Company reserves the right to audit use of Deliverables, issue cease-and-desist notices, and pursue damages for any unauthorized use or modification.</p>
        
        <p>All Deliverables are digitally versioned and tracked to ensure authenticity, integrity, and traceability of code ownership.</p>
        
        <h3>6.8 Indemnity</h3>
        <p>The Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Moth Solutions from any claims arising out of the Client's misuse, redistribution, or unauthorized alteration of Deliverables.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions shall defend and indemnify the Client against third-party claims alleging that Deliverables infringe valid intellectual property rights, provided the Client promptly notifies the Company and allows it to control the defense.</p>
        
        <h3>6.9 Survival</h3>
        <p>All intellectual property obligations, ownership clauses, and license restrictions shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd's intellectual property framework ensures that innovation remains protected, clients receive lawful rights of use, and all technology deployed under the Company's name meets the highest global standards of compliance, originality, and integrity.</p>

        <h2>7. Confidentiality and Security</h2>
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd recognizes confidentiality and data security as fundamental pillars of trust and professional integrity.

        <p>Personal data is processed strictly in accordance with lawful bases, and the Company ensures transparency, minimization, and purpose limitation principles.</p>
        
        <p>Where Moth Solutions acts as a data processor on behalf of the Client, a separate Data Processing Agreement (DPA) will define roles, responsibilities, and security measures.</p>
        
        <p>Unless explicitly agreed in writing, Moth Solutions does not collect, process, or store the personal data of the Client's end users.</p>

        <p>The Company implements an enterprise-level security framework including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>End-to-end data encryption (in transit and at rest);</li>
          <li>Multi-factor authentication and access control policies;</li>
          <li>Network firewalls and intrusion detection systems;</li>
          <li>Periodic security audits and vulnerability testing;</li>
          <li>Enforced version control and secure code repositories.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All systems are regularly updated, monitored, and maintained according to industry best practices such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST standards.</p>
        
        <h3>7.5 Incident Management and Breach Notification</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions maintains a documented Incident Response Plan outlining procedures for detection, containment, and mitigation of any potential data or security breach.</p>
        
        <p>In the event of a confirmed breach affecting Client data, Moth Solutions shall:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notify the Client without undue delay;</li>
          <li>Provide a detailed summary of the incident and the measures taken;</li>
          <li>Cooperate fully with investigations and regulatory reporting obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>7.6 Retention and Destruction of Data</h3>
        <p>Confidential data is retained only for the duration necessary to perform contractual obligations or comply with legal requirements.</p>
        
        <p>Upon project completion or termination, Moth Solutions will securely delete or return all Client-provided data, unless retention is required by law or written agreement.</p>
        
        <h3>7.7 Security of Third-Party Integrations</h3>
        <p>Where Services include third-party hosting, APIs, or software integrations, Moth Solutions ensures due diligence in selecting reputable vendors that meet equivalent security and privacy standards.</p>
        
        <p>The Company remains responsible for ensuring that its third-party partners operate within the same security parameters required under this Agreement.</p>
        
        <h3>7.8 Non-Disclosure Survival</h3>
        <p>All confidentiality and security obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Both parties remain bound to protect Confidential Information disclosed during the course of the engagement indefinitely or for as long as such information remains confidential by nature.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd's confidentiality and security framework reflects its commitment to protecting the data, trust, and reputation of its clients through rigorous compliance, proactive monitoring, and continuous improvement of its information security practices.</p>

        <h2>8. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd delivers all Services and Software with the highest professional care and diligence consistent with industry standards. However, as software inherently depends on variable external environments and third‑party systems, the Company limits its warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        
        <h3>8.1 Scope of Warranty</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions warrants that all Deliverables will materially conform to the functional specifications and scope outlined in the signed Statement of Work (SOW) for a period of 30 days following final delivery, unless otherwise stated in the project documentation.</p>
        
        <p>During the warranty period, the Company will correct verified defects or deviations from the agreed specification at no additional cost, provided that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Client promptly reports the issue in writing;</li>
          <li>The defect is reproducible and attributable to the delivered code or configuration;</li>
          <li>No unauthorized modifications have been made by the Client or a third party.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Beyond the warranty period, maintenance and support are governed by separate service agreements or retainers, if applicable.</p>
        
        <h3>8.2 Exclusions from Warranty</h3>
        <p>The warranty does not apply to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Errors resulting from misuse, alteration, or integration of the Deliverables with unsupported environments or third‑party software not approved by Moth Solutions.</li>
          <li>Failures caused by hardware malfunctions, system configuration changes, or external factors such as hosting failures, API disruptions, or network outages.</li>
          <li>Situations where the Client fails to provide accurate, timely, or complete information necessary for project success.</li>
          <li>Any functionality, feature, or integration that was not explicitly included in the documented project scope.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.3 General Disclaimer of Liability</h3>
        <p>Except as expressly provided in this section, all Services, Software, and Deliverables are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non‑infringement.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions does not guarantee that the Deliverables will operate uninterrupted, error‑free, or in combination with all possible systems, environments, or third‑party services.</p>
        
        <p>The Company disclaims any responsibility for damages resulting from Client decisions, reliance on outputs, or use of Deliverables outside the documented purpose.</p>
        
        <h3>8.4 Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Moth Solutions' total aggregate liability—whether in contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise—shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Client under the specific project or SOW giving rise to the claim.</p>
        
        <p>Under no circumstances shall Moth Solutions be liable for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential losses;</li>
          <li>Loss of profit, revenue, business opportunity, data, or goodwill;</li>
          <li>Any third‑party claims arising from the Client's use or modification of the Deliverables.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Client acknowledges that this limitation of liability is a fundamental component of the contractual relationship and reflects a fair allocation of risk between the parties.</p>
        
        <h3>8.5 External Dependencies and Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions shall not be held responsible for delays, damages, or loss of access caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to cyberattacks, power outages, wars, pandemics, strikes, or acts of government ("Force Majeure Events").</p>
        
        <p>In such circumstances, the Company's obligations are suspended for the duration of the disruption. Moth Solutions will take reasonable steps to mitigate its effects and resume performance as soon as practicable.</p>
        
        <h3>8.6 Indemnification by Client</h3>
        <p>The Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Moth Solutions from any loss, liability, or expense arising from misuse, misrepresentation, or unlawful deployment of the Deliverables by the Client or its representatives.</p>
        
        <p>This includes claims by third parties arising from intellectual property violations, misuse of data, or failure to comply with local laws while using Deliverables provided by Moth Solutions.</p>
        
        <h3>8.7 Survival of Obligations</h3>
        <p>All warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnity provisions in this section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, ensuring continued legal protection for Moth Solutions.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd provides all technology and services with precision, compliance, and professional integrity but cannot assume responsibility for outcomes beyond its contractual control. This section ensures a balanced distribution of responsibility, protecting both the Client's investment and the Company's long‑term operational stability.</p>

      <section class="document-section">
        <h2>9. Term and Termination</h2>
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd defines the conditions under which this Agreement may commence, continue, and conclude in order to preserve contractual integrity, operational continuity, and mutual accountability. This section governs the duration of engagement, termination rights, and post‑termination obligations.</p>
        
        <h3>9.1 Duration and Commencement</h3>
        <p>This Agreement becomes effective on the date of signature or acceptance of a formal Statement of Work (SOW), quotation, or electronic confirmation provided by Moth Solutions.</p>
        
        <p>The Agreement remains in force until all contractual obligations have been fulfilled, or until terminated in accordance with this section.</p>
        
        <p>Each new project, amendment, or change request issued by the Client and accepted by Moth Solutions constitutes a separate contractual engagement governed by these Terms.</p>
        
        <h3>9.2 Termination by the Client</h3>
        <p>The Client may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing written notice of termination to Moth Solutions.</p>
        
        <p>Early termination of an ongoing project requires settlement of all outstanding invoices and payment for work completed up to the date of termination, including partially delivered milestones and committed resources.</p>
        
        <p>Any advance payments for services not yet performed may be refunded only if explicitly defined in the contract and subject to internal verification of non‑delivery.</p>
        
        <h3>9.3 Termination by Moth Solutions</h3>
        <p>Moth Solutions may, at its sole discretion, suspend or terminate the Agreement with immediate effect if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Client fails to make payments within agreed timeframes;</li>
          <li>The Client breaches material terms of the Agreement, including misuse of Deliverables, intellectual property violations, or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information;</li>
          <li>The Client becomes insolvent, enters liquidation, or is otherwise unable to fulfil its financial obligations;</li>
          <li>Continued cooperation poses a legal, reputational, or security risk to Moth Solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In such cases, the Company reserves the right to retain any sums already paid and to recover additional costs incurred as a result of the breach or termination.</p>
        
        <h3>9.4 Notice Period and Process</h3>
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, either party must provide a minimum 14‑day written notice prior to termination of ongoing services.</p>
        
        <p>All termination notices must be delivered electronically to legal@moth.solutions and acknowledged by the receiving party.</p>
        
        <p>Upon termination, both parties shall cooperate to ensure an orderly transition, including the secure transfer or deletion of Client data.</p>
        
        <h3>9.5 Consequences of Termination</h3>
        <p>Upon termination, all rights granted to the Client immediately cease, except those expressly stated as surviving termination.</p>
        
        <p>The Client retains ownership or license rights only to Deliverables that have been fully paid for.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions will provide the Client with all completed and accepted Deliverables within seven (7) business days of final payment.</p>
        
        <p>All outstanding fees, including accrued expenses, are due immediately upon termination.</p>
        
        <h3>9.6 Suspension of Services</h3>
        <p>The Company may suspend ongoing work temporarily in the event of non‑payment, security incidents, or legal disputes, with or without prior notice where immediate protection of assets or compliance is necessary.</p>
        
        <p>Suspension does not waive the Client's payment obligations or deadlines for milestones already in progress.</p>
        
        <p>Reinstatement of services may require full settlement of outstanding balances and a written reinstatement agreement.</p>
        
        <h3>9.7 Survival of Clauses</h3>
        <p>The following sections shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement: Intellectual Property (Section 6), Confidentiality and Security (Section 7), Payment Obligations (Section 5), Warranties and Disclaimers (Section 8), Governing Law (Section 12), and any indemnity or limitation of liability provisions.</p>
        
        <h3>9.8 Post‑Termination Cooperation</h3>
        <p>Upon mutual agreement, Moth Solutions may provide paid assistance during project handover or migration to another vendor.</p>
        
        <p>All proprietary software tools, scripts, or automation used internally by Moth Solutions remain its property and are not included in the handover unless explicitly licensed.</p>
        
        <p>The Client must cease any use of proprietary systems or materials beyond the rights granted under Section 6.</p>
        
        <p>Moth Solutions Ltd ensures that project termination is governed by transparent, documented procedures protecting both parties' financial and legal interests. This approach guarantees professional closure, compliance with contractual duties, and preservation of business continuity for Clients.</p>
